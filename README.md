# Genetics
A little project to play with genetic algorithm in swift

- handle a population
- handle perception of population (not the same thing as the environment itself)
- do event based on iteration (year for now)
- each creature has characteristics based on dna
- The dna can mutate
- The reproduction appears once a year with creatures based on attraction perceived

TODO :
- View aspect (now only print based)
- Danger
- new characteristics
- food
- interactions
